        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is Smitten Kitchen's Lasagna Bolegnese recipe. Described on their website as "my culinary Mount Everest", this lasagna will knock your socks off. It's a twenty layer monster of noodles, ragu, bechamel and cheese. Stemming from a hatred of traditional ricotta-included lasagna, this chef set off on a multi-year journey.

                This is not a recipe for the time-constrained. Each ingredient is prepared from scratch by hand. The author recommends giving yourself and entire <strong>day</strong> to tackle the sauce. The next day is dedicated to noodles and layering. Be warned.
